Problem Statement - MVBB

Title:  Motor Vehicle Black Box
By considering today's busy life, every one wants to reach the destination as soon as possible by ignoring the rules and regulations. So one solution could be by implementing a Black Box which would log critical activities on the vehicle.

Mentor: Syed Adil, adil_sk@emertxe.com

Problem Background
In busy cities like Bangalore, Mumbai etc.,  we all observe how the public transport vehicles operate harshly to meet their daily schedules by ignoring the public safety and the maintenance of the vehicle.

Problem Statement
As mentioned above the root cause of the negligence in the driving would be meeting the daily schedule and go off duty, or to earn extra money by illegal trips etc,. So by implementing the mentioned solution it would be easy to keep track of how the vehicle is being used, handled and control the efficiency of the vehicle.

Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to log all the critical events like the gear shifts with current speed, the engine temperature, fuel consumption per trip, trip distance etc., The system should allow a password based access to the transport managers to view or download the log to PC if required.
